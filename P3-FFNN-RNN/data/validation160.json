They have just been having the worst service i have ever seen from that place. it's impossible to notice they aren't as busy as they used to be because most of their clients have left. My sister, nieces, my mother, some of my friends all used to go there as well but stopped and switched to a different nail salon because of how terrible their customer service has gotten and their nails aren't as good as they used to be. Today I called them twice around 1:15pm before going in and got no answer so i figured they were busy but i went in they weren't busy at all so then i proceed to ask about how long for a gel manicure, the young man asked and the heavier set lady, that always has a ugly attitude and always messed up my nails and eyebrows, responded with \"we don't know how long so if you can wait we can do them for you and if you can't then you can go\" i looked at the young man and he said with a smirk on his face \"we don't know how long\" i looked at them in shock and i was going to wait but they didn't deserve my money after the service they had just given me, so i said \"ok thanks\" and left. I am now getting my nails done at Red Nails on 24st and baseline and i'm highly satisfied! I called right after i left Pro ten with their disgusting service and asked them the SAME question i asked at pro ten and red nails told me \"10-15 minutes\". i showed up and was greeted and sat immediately AND they were A LOT more busier than pro ten. I have now found my new Nail Salon for now on, recommended by my sister and nieces, RED NAILS AND SPA on 24st & Baseline!

They have won numerous awards for excellence which are displayed in the office.\n\nThe staff is accommodating and pleasant. The owner is usually present in the shop as well. If there is extra work that might need to be performed while your vehicle is being serviced they will contact you before the work is done or parts are ordered to verify you want the work completed.\n\nThey offer a shuttle service for major work (read: not oil changes), which is great if you can't talk someone into driving you around. And if you do have to wait there are a few restaurants around the area you can walk to and relax at.

We moved out from California. The apartment we were supposed to move into looked like a war zone. The front door was dented, both the dead bolt and door handle looked as if some took a crowbar to them. Once inside we noticed that they did a half assed job at cleaning the apartment. We found a used q-tip in one of the bedrooms. There was what appeared to be knife marks in walls. \n\nThey made this right by giving us an \"upgraded apartment\". \n\nWe got moved in all seemed to be ok. Well the first rain came and that all changed(See the posted photos). The ceiling leaked causing what we called our ceiling zit. They fixed the roof but not the ceiling right away. Next rain it happened again. So they came back out and supposedly fixed the roof again. Some time later they had a gentleman come out and make the repairs to the inside and he did a great job except he didn't paint the wall and it remained that way until we moved out. \n\nCalled the police once for some crackhead and her boyfriend that were blowing weed smoke into her sons face. The son was about 4-5 years old. They finally evicted them. \n\nThey did a facelift on the apartment complex which was just polishing a turd. One of the things they did was to change out all light bulbs and in doing so the new kitchen fixture was smaller than the previous one. Not horrible but you could see up into the roof and it just look awful. That probably has not been fixed. \n\nNewest Management (not sure of the name)\n\nThese folks seemed to be ok. We asked for an extension and it was granted and I am thankful for that. \n\nThis is where it all goes south. We have two cats. We paid the pet deposit. We paid the monthly pet rent. Upon move out we cleaned, we mopped and we had carpets cleaned. I was asked by maintenance days before move out if there was anything wrong with the apartment. I told the gentleman everything that was wrong and he said it's all good and don't worry about anything. The woman that did the final walk-thru was shocked at how clean the apartment was and that it didn't even look like we lived there that long( at this point I was under the assumption that we would receive more than 50% of our deposit back.

The only thing I would change in that meal is the rice. For some reason it tasted really smoky for Mexican rice and I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be like that.

Where venison can sometimes be gamey or even tough, here it worked, and the flavors were excellent.

Sweet.\n\nThen she had a salad wedge.  I've never been a huge fan of the wedge, because it means you get a head of lettuce and cut it into quarters (or some other section).  Come on - chop it up.  Wedges are a cop out.  But she seemed to enjoy it.\n\nFor dinner, she had a flounder sandwich and I had a blackened flounder plate with grit cake.  She enjoyed the sandwich.  My blackened flounder had next to no flavor.  The grit cake wasn't bad, but had a really strange consistency.  Instead of being a cake, it had a very thick outside and an almost runny inside.  Then there was a mixed mess of veggies on the plate, which was probably the best thing that I had.\n\nWe also had a blueberry cheesecake thing for dessert.  Not bad, but not overly impressive.  It's like a no-bake cheesecake in a graham cracker pie shell.
