Even by 7, there were so many open tables, I'm not sure what all the fuss was about. \nAnyway, they asked us if we wanted to sit inside or out. We chose to sit inside and were seated in this dark dungeon of an area near the wine cellar where none of the other guests were seated. I'm sure this was due in part to the presence of my son (but he is soooo good in restaurants, honestly).\nThis was still alright with me, except for the number of fruit flies that would not leave us alone. One even made it into my husband's glass of wine. I pointed this out to our server and he measured out the amount of wine left in my husband's glass to replace it. He also saw us swatting at flies, but never offered to seat us elsewhere. It was embarrassing that a restaurant of this caliber would have this problem and not address it. It was unfortunate because the food was actually good. We had the cervella (lamb brain), nodini (bread knots), bigoli (duck egg pasta with duck offal ragu), pig's blood pasta, tiramisu, and panacotta.

Last night my husband and I celebrated our sixth wedding anniversary.  After much debate on where we were going to celebrate Fogo won our votes.  We've visited another similar style restaurant in Ahwatukee so we knew what we were in for - or did we?  Fogo last night was very happily a different experience from the last time we did a Brazilian steak house.  This was upscale and so much more busy.  We made reservations on line and while we were five minutes late - it wasn't even an issue.  For the record we had an incredible time and I guess the next few things are just minor but I think would have added another star.  My hubby is chatty and can strike up conversation with anyone.  But the staff was not so much into it.  They didn't engage his quick little one liners and didn't feel obliged to \"listen\" to anything.  The expeditors were a little more willing but not by much.  I was seriously starting to get nervous by how fast everyone moves @ the restaurant.  So fast in fact a collision happened right in front of us.  Plates went everywhere.  The hubby tried (for the record this was his third attempt) to engage a gaucho about how they cook the meat - this gentleman looked @ Josh and said \"hmmm I dunno\" - I got the feeling he didn't understand what was being asked of him.  He just knew to cut the meat off the skewer and continue on.  Perhaps that's what they have been advised to do.  Not sure.  It was just awkward.  Everything was good.  The cherry peppers were delish (my first time) all of the meat was delish.  Not very seasoned but good.  The purity was awesome.  The salad bar was great.  I made the best Caesar salad I've had in a while.  The mozz and parm were FANTASTIC!  Hubby loved the little bread basket. The wait staff said that they were told what goes into it but not so much how to make them.  (you see a pattern here with the chatty)  :)  At the end of the night when we could take no more we were approaching comaville we waited for our staff person to bring the check.  This is what confuses me.  Who are we tipping.  The gauchos, the really sweet gal that never let my water go empty, the cutie that \"crumbed\" our table?  The gal previously mentioned asked if we had received our check.  And then went to find it.  When everyone was running around furiously this is where we waited the most?

Overall, my entire experience has been very negative.

So I was given a prescription for \"computer\" and \"reading\" glasses.  After wearing my new computer glasses a few days, I noticed that my distant vision had worsen because watching T.V. or even looking at a person or object 10 feet away was very blurry. Mind you, I have never had issues with distance but only up close.  My eyes felt so strained and dry which I have never experienced before with my previous reading glasses.\n\n2ND VISIT:  NOT PROFICIENT\n\nI called and spoke with Mollie (office manager) to see if I could come back in and have Dr. Ethington test my eyes again. She agreed that I should.  After explaining my situation, Dr. Ethington retested my eyes and gave me 4 prescriptions (distant, near, progressive, and computer). Wow..talk about confusing  My reputable opthamologist from CA only gave me reading glasses (2.50+) which I still use.\n\nIn reviewing the new prescriptions, I was wondering why there was such a drastic change from the first two from initial visit.  I did not feel comfortable getting my glasses redone and be stuck with two pairs of glasses with incorrect prescriptions.  \n\nPOOR SERVICE:\nI called to see if I could speak Dr. Ethington over the phone to address my concern which would save the inconvenience of going back to the office again.  I left three messages with three different people in the office (Muriel, Austin, and Mark) and sent a detailed email to Mollie on 11/20/17 and to date have not heard back from anyone.  Very disappointing and unprofessional to not return a patient's call.\n\nI should have gone with my instincts from the beginning that this was not a right fit for me.  There were all kinds of red flags (not being able to book with opthamologist, billing error, not being informed of dry eye condition).\n\nOverall my experience has not been the most positive and smooth. I've decided to search for a new Optometrist for a second opinion of the prescriptions I have been given. I found one close by that has higher ratings. They have more state of the art technology. Not sure about you but my eyes are important to me and I want a doctor and an office that is is proficient. Personally, I don't feel Dr. Ethington is very thorough or accurate.

We got the Baba Ghannouj to share and liked it. An unexpected smoky taste, almost like barbecue sauce, but enjoyable nonetheless. My girlfriend got a falafel wrap, pretty average. I got some meat items off the A la carte menu, and they were really good, cooked to medium just as requested. I also got a glass of the mint iced tea and quite liked it. \n\nHowever, the service we received was abysmal. Normally, that wouldn't really bother me - sometimes you go to a restaurant and you get bad service. Besides, the quality of the food is really what I'm concerned with when going out to eat. But the reason I bring this up and the reason the terrible service angered me, is that over the course of our meal, it became clear that my girlfriend and I were receiving substantially different service than the other customers in the restaurant.\n\nEveryone else seemed to be getting the standard gracious and considerate treatment of a professional waitstaff. We felt as if, in the eyes of the staff, we were barely there. \n\nFirst, we were seated without menus or the complementary bread. When both arrived a few minutes later upon request, we then had to wait another 10 or 15 minutes before a waitress came over to take our order. We noticed that other tables seated after us were able to place their orders first. When the Baba Ghannouj came out as our appetizer, it came without additional bread (never had this happen in a Mid Eastern place, and we saw that other customers were not treated as such). After we finished the complementary bread, not once did anyone offer, or simply take the initiative, to bring out some more. Again, never seen this happen in any restaurant that provides complementary bread - though we saw other customers receive a second heaping of bread, no questions asked.  \n\nOur main course finally arrived. Or rather, mine arrived, and my girlfriend had to wait several more minutes for hers. Basic restaurant etiquette would say that you aim to serve a couple at the same time. Don't want to put one person in the uncomfortable, potentially rude position of eating while the other stares, right?\n\nWhen hers came out, we both dug into the food, and like I said above, enjoyed it. But as more time elapsed, I started to notice other little things in terms of the service. We spent about an hour at our table last night. Not once during the hour did anyone offer or act to refill our waters. Not once were we asked \"Hey, how's everything? How's the food?\". Not once did the waitstaff suggest we purchase more food. Hell, when we were served, the waitress barely made eye contact with either of us. It felt as if she wanted to minimize her interactions with us as much as possible. \n\nAgain, the staff seemed amiable and affable with all others in the restaurant. For some reason, my girlfriend and I were pariahs.\n\nOnce it was clear we were done with our meal, that's when the service went into turbo drive. Our waitress came over, asked if we were done and if we needed a take-home box. She immediately said she'd get the check, not probing us to see if we would be up for coffee or dessert. Back and forth she went, grabbing bags, boxes, and the bill, with a speed that was wholly absent for the past hour. \n\nFinally, before paying the bill, I asked to speak with the manager. One of the waitresses came over (she's part of the family who owns the place) to hear our grievances. We talked with her a bit, though she eventually got agitated as we pointed out how we received sub-standard service. Another waitress then came over (note: neither were our primary waitress, but we noticed that since the place was fairly small and fairly crowded, the three of them were pitching in wherever they could. Except with us.) to continue the conversation. She heard us out more than the other. \n\nAs I detailed the examples of poor service throughout the evening, she had a convenient answer for everything. We were out of menus when you were seated. It's busy, so we lost track of you for a bit. Other people ordered pre-made items, that's why their food came out so fast. In her view, it was a string of coincidences that led to the misperception that we were treated any differently. But as we pressed her further and insisted that we received substantially different service, she changed her tune. When my girlfriend brought up that no one even made eye contact with her during the night, we were told it was because we had been rude and had given off a rude vibe early in the meal.\n\nI was blown away. They came over so little, that we didn't even have the opportunity to be rude. I acted no differently than I have at any restaurant I've been my entire life. This was all new to me.

The price for 3 courses is $35 (not including drinks, coffee/tea, etc.) which is a good price.  But we didn't go there to save money, we went because of its reputation for great food, and the prix fixe menu definitely had limited options, which was too bad.  I'd suggest they should make it clearer on OpenTable or whatever reservation channel that they're running a limited choice menu.\n\n-Disorganized front desk: I've never been in a more disorganized, more chaotic waiting area.  We arrived for our reservation on time, and waited 30 minutes before being seated (they did give us champagne while we waited which was a nice touch, but 30 minutes is a long time to stand - no chairs!).  Because the restaurant is a converted old house, the foyer is big enough for about 3 people comfortably, and 6 people were jammed in waiting.  The kitchen is 4 steps from the waiting area, with an open doorway looking right in.  So while you wait 30 minutes for your table, you see the food being cooked.  Seems cool the first 5 minutes, but then you realize it's hot and chaotic.  The waiters have to push through the group of waiting diners every 5 seconds, so you're milling around like cattle trying to get out of their way.  Plus you hear a lot of the back-of-the-house grumbling from the waitstaff and chef (yelling at each other that they fired the wrong dish, sent plates to the wrong table, \"table 4 wants MORE bread, what!?!?\" and my favorite \"well, no one's closing out their bill so what the hell am I supposed to do?\")  It's not exactly the romantic relaxed environment the website advertises.  When you're eventually seated upstairs, the environment is cozy and relaxing, but I think the mood had kind of been dampened by 30 minutes in the pit downstairs.\n\n-Inconsistent service: In their defense, they seemed to be having a gangbusters night that they didn't expect, so I guess their service team was just overwhelmed.  Our server was a nice guy, but so slow.  The meal last almost 3 hours, and not because we wanted it to.  There was a crazy long wait between each course, and after waiting 30 minutes for our dessert, the waiter ducked back in with the bill, only to realize we'd never even gotten the dessert....  \n\nOverall, I'd suggest going on a less busy night (weekday maybe?) as I don't think they handle crowds well.

My platter was literally served on a platter and was only $12. The chicken was a small piece, but the breast was surprisingly meaty. It was very tender and juicy and covered in their delicious BBQ. The ribs were a little bit on the dry side. They were certainly not falling off the bone and they required a little extra BBQ, but they were by no means bad. Again, for the price, they were awesome. The baked beans were very very tasty. They were made with their BBQ and almost had a sweet chili taste to them. I'm not normally a baked beans fan, but I devoured these. The french fries were french fries, but in a massive portion... They were basically a restaurant version of McDonald's fries, which is not a bad thing. The sugar biscuits were the same thing that you find at Chinese buffets, but they were much fresher then you'd find at any buffet. \n\nAll together, I was very pleased with Sauceman's. They serve cheaper restaurant quality food, but in a Cook Out or Penguin style setting. You order at the counter and then they bring it to you at your seat. You refill your drinks yourself and when you are done, they clear your table for you.

I asked for a polish sausage but was given a kielbasa; no biggie. Paid for my food and also bought a brownie. The person at the counter said they're baked fresh every Sunday, and these were part of that batch. Sunday was 5 days ago. I think a week is too long to have brownies sitting in a warm restaurant. The place wasn't very sanitary; extremely small, but could still be clean. Rather grimey.\n\nThose few things weren't the worst part, though. There was a wing of some type of insect in my sandwich.

She wouldn't even say if or how long our wait was, \"Unless your full party is here.\"  I could understand not being seated, but the rude tone and nonsensical retort that they can't even give you an estimate on wait time got things off to a poor start.  Then, we were seated immediately when our family members arrived.\n\nThe menu is simple enough and the food was good, but not great.  Salads were unremarkable.  The Fillet Mignon was very good.

It's slightly higher end, it's new-er, it's trendy and now that I'm not graduate student poor, I'll splurge a little. Also, I always book through Visa Signature because you get additional perks like VIP status, $25 food and beverage credit, automatic room upgrade, etc. The best perk for Cosmo is the free breakfast at Wicked Spoon that's included, which is one of the big reasons why we stay here. Especially considering it's $35/pp for breakfast on the weekends that's like getting $70 more. You're also entitled to check in at the VIP autograph lounge where there's coffee, water, paper, and shorter lines.\n\nDespite being not so new anymore the hotel is still \"hot\". It's trendy, a lot of people my age and slightly older stay here. Though I hate Marquee (their club) with a passion, it still seems really popular. They've got a few bars, like the chandelier and Vesper which are cool hang out spots and have great, albeit expensive drinks. It's just a \"happening\" hotel still so staying here is really convenient, you're part of the action automatically by virtue of being present. It's great for people like me who enjoy shitshows but don't want to partake. Their location is also excellent, we never had to drive once. It's across the bridge from miracle mile shops, walking distance for walgreens and earl of sandwich. We also somehow walked all the way to NYNY too for shake shack. Either way, thumbs way way up for not having to grab cabs or ubers the entire weekend. \n\nI've stayed in the Terrace One Bedroom and also the Terrace Studio. Obviously the bedroom is more expensive because of the Japanese soaking tub but the studio has the jet tub. Either way I find both comfortable, there's a large living area, a kitchenette, super soft king sized bed, big closets and a terrace. Their suites are pretty massive anyway so it's great to have your friends over and hang out. The mini fridge is slightly annoying because it's all rigged with temptations, like a can of coke for $6 and you can't use it to chill your own drinks unless you put it in the freezer section. There's rigged snacks and shaving kits, etc on the counter but there's also a mini bottle opener for free you can use which is thoughtful! I panicked for a moment when I tried to open my wine and had realized I didn't bring a bottle opener. Appreciate the touch! \n\nThey've also got very nice quality robes and slippers and C.O. Bigelow toiletries! Usually shampoo/conditioner from a hotel is total crap but theirs is actually decent. The rooms and hallways show wear and tear but they've done a decent job of covering it up. I imagine in a few years they'll need to redo carpeting and give the place a fresh coat of paint. Also, Cosmo is super clean and reminded me a little of my private undergraduate university, people are cleaning ALL THE TIME. It's ridiculous, you can see people cleaning 24/7, everywhere. There are many people who work very hard to maintain the hotel so be nice to them!!! Tip generously. Aside from this the casinos are also one of the cleanest ever, somehow the cigarette smoke is absorbed and dispelled elsewhere so you don't stink of cigarettes while you walk around. \n\nParking is free which is great and may no longer be a perk we can enjoy in vegas much more, staff are courteous and nice. I wish they were a bit more clear on the perks for booking through visa signature. I've done this twice and each time they forget to tack on the $25 food/bev credit so I always have to go down to the check out desk. Either way, I always have a good time here and it's really appropriate for where I am in my life now that I don't want to get dressed up, wait 20 minutes in cold for cab, get ripped off, get in line for 40 minutes to get into some dumb club. I'd rather have one nice $16 drink than a bunch of Fat Tuesdays, this is the hot yuppie hotel for me! \n\nAlso Yelp just reminded me by asking \"good for kids\" the answer is NO. Vegas as a city unless you're doing something wholesome like seeing the hoover dam or grand canyon is NOT good for children. My friends saw a couple with a damn STROLLER at 11PM at night in the elevators here. A drunken person almost ran into their stroller/baby and it's vegas, can you REALLY blame the person for being drunk in sin city or the irresponsible parents who are keeping their infant out past 11pm? Ugh, just think through what you're doing parents.\n\nOne FINAL thought, I HATE the bathroom walls. I've posted a picture and you can see it's black wallpaper with a repeating silhouette of conjoined girls dancing or something and when you're hungover or puking it's THE WORST.

Being conjoined with Paris meant that as you walked inside and down the escalator from the parking lot into the main halls you were invited by Parisian facades and spectacle that is Vegas; however, it is classy and doesn't try to overwhelm you with senses. Instead the show element melded with just enough sophistication to give you luxury that didn't over- or underwhelm you.\n\nCasino Floor Deco - 4\n\nI still find their styling and design so refreshing and classical without looking too dated. Like a fine, middle grade wine, this casino floor is aging well. The ceilings are still clean. The tables are in good condition and the dress code for the dealers is still a classic look of dress shirts and vests. It's no Cosmopolitan, and truly nothing anywhere in Vegas is, but this isn't a budget casino.\n\nHotel Room Deco - 3\n\nWalking into the hotel room and you can start to see how the years have taken a toll. For the most part the rooms are standard and I mean that in the most general way. From the dark wood stain to the set up of the TV cabinet and bed tables there is nothing fancy about it. It's a basic setup and it works well. Some of the wallpaper in the bathroom has seen better days and the bathing supplies given complimentary isn't necessarily the greatest either but the rooms work. Enough to keep you comfortable and also keep you out to enjoy the rest of Vegas.\n\nPrice - 3\n\nThe pricing for Bally's in my opinion is very fair. Because they are more of a middle range casino their prices will usually range in the lower side compared to places like the Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, and The Linq (all located in the periphery of Bally's). With such a great location Bally's really is a great place to call home base yet still get to see all Vegas has to offer around it for a budget price.\n\nCasino - 4\n\nBy no means is Bally's the largest casino floor but it is all placed and located even through a floor that can be seen easily from the lobby. It has every game you might want and some you don't. It is a place where you can find your friends easily if you get lost and not such an eyesore where you want to seek refuge outside as soon as possible. For the most part the dealers are quite pleasant and if you get onto the right table you might have a nice conversation if nothing else.\n\nConclusion\n\nBally's will always have a place in my heart because of the wonderment it brought me when I first arrived to Vegas. With the easy transport from Bally's to Paris and the eye candy in between it really is a great casino to stay for any frugal traveler looking for a good room with enough money remained to paint the town.", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "pretty decent pastrami sandwich.

Not bad, but a bit too sweet for a starter.   \n\nFor a main course we split the shepherd's pie, of which only two are baked per night. Having arrived 30 minutes after they opened, we got there just in time to have the last one! Very exciting.  Again, the plating of the dish was very nice. It was molded into the shape of a small cake, baked in a crust of prosciutto and drowned in brown gravy.  Clawing past the porcine armor with our forks, we found it filled with carrots chopped into mashed potatoes, sitting on a thin layer of hamburger. Not much for $30, but it looked great. Unfortunately, the intense saltiness of the gravy and the prosciutto overshadowed any other flavor that may have existed in the dish. The sodium burned my pallet so badly, that I couldn't even manage the last few bites.  \n\nOkay, so we knew now that this place was not worth the money, but at least we could just apply the cost of the Google Offer and never come back again... at least that is what we thought (and were told on the phone). The owner of the establishment came out to tell us, that we could not do this due to the stipulations in the original coupon.  I patiently informed him that this is no longer a deal -- since the Offer had expired -- but I simply a redeeming of $50 which was already paid. I was rebuffed.  After several minutes of arguing, he agreed to apply the $50 only to food but not to drinks.  More arguing ensued, and out of frustration we paid for the drinks and left. \n\nThus, the owner -- not the waiter or a manager -- of this overpriced \"unpretentious fine dining\" establishment squabbled with us for 10 minutes over a paltry $13 which we had already paid, effectively cheating me out of $26.

They had a very good selection, all on display, from inexpensive portable models through the Sony-Pioneer-Denon range up to a few very high-end models. I browsed around a little in the other audio sections, and they seemed to be similar in selection and price ranges. They also have a wide range of other products from video to car stereo to cell phones and lots of accessories.\n\nI ended up buying the Pioneer model that evening because it was the last day of the sale, but the salesman was nice enough to hold it for me until I could pick it up the next day, which was also easy even though that salesman was not there.

One, building rapport with a business just makes life easier. We have built ours so in a way our reviews may come off a slight biased. With that in mind, I stick to 4 stars because I LOVE that Tea Time doesn't look like some hipster ass joint. No fancy decor, trendy artwork, etc...some people like that. I don't. Would it be nice? Of course. But as much boba shops I've been to that offer me such view...it's a nice break. The thing about Tea Time is you don't come in here with a is it all hype? I don't think they should be regarded in that way. That's not an insult! Seriously. We've come here so much we have seen it grow, seen it trying to figure itself out, make adjustments and just try to find a way to get better. I don't feel like they're trying to be a part of the \"hype\". Who wants to be a \"hype\". They're here to just serve you up drinks to refresh you, enlighten you, or to just wake your ass up.

If I'm feeling like bumping my sugar levels up...ill order a brown sugar chai smoothie which is deeeeelish and has never tasted watered down. Note, I order all my drinks with soymilk. Any dairy we will have a situ-lation. \n\nI mean honestly, if you don't like your drink or would like it to get adjusted...just let them know. Everyone has their own preference. This is where the building rapport kicks in because they know how I like my drink so I'm pass the part of worrying if my drink will come out the way I like. They can also adjust your sweetness, if you have allergies or dairy issues they can adjust that too. \n\nThey probably could use a few more bodies to help with the bumrush because I've definitely seen a two man crew get slammed which causes everyone's orders to take longer especially during a rush. And if you're in a rush...no bueno. \n\nIf there's something that isn't on the menu drink wise, don't be afraid to ask if they can whip up whatever it is you have in mind. They just might be able to and will have no problem doing so. Also, if you have kids...you can order a large drink, and split it into two different cups. Annnnnd if you lug kids around like i do and just want regular fries versus the fries on their food menu...they can do that too. \n\nThe bias part that kicks in is that service has always been good to us. I can't speak for everyone...but I did say we come here ALOT.\n\nAmple parking and stroller friendly. Definitely recommend if you are in the area looking for such drinks. There is also another boba spot not too far, but I don't go there because while they have vegan snacks, they don't offer alternatives if you have dairy/lactose issues.

I was mislead by the location because of the picture but that is on me. The following is the complaint I will be submitting to the American Psychiatric Association for the treatment I received at her office:\nI visited Dr. Saleha Baig's office on 9/19/17 at 4pm with an appointment time of 4:15. I knew I would need to fill out new patient paperwork so I arrived early. After completing the paperwork, I was waiting in the waiting room with about 4 other patients. Dr. Baig's office door was left open and I could clearly hear every conversation with every patient. This made me question her confidentiality of patient information but I was in need of a new doctor for a prescription refill so I continued to wait. After two hours of waiting I finally was called back to Dr. Baig's office. Her door was still left open when I came in but I was the last patient since it was just after 6pm. She proceeded to greet me and I began to tell her a bit about my background. Then she asked if I was still taking the medications (she said about five different medications) and I said no I had no idea what she was talking about and then she called me by the wrong patient last name and she realized I not only I was a completely different patient, but I was a brand new patient. She then immediately stood up and started yelling for her receptionist Diane. Diane then entered Dr. Baig's office and Dr. Baig was scolding her in front of me about not scheduling new patients at six o'clock. That is when the receptionist informed her that my appointment was at 4:15 and I had been waiting the whole time. Dr. Baig continued to scold her saying she could not have new patients after four and that the receptionist is overbooking her and this is unacceptable. I then told Dr. Baig she did not need to see me and I could find another doctor. Dr. Baig said I could stay and she would see me but continued to scold the receptionist, and explain that she would need to pray and then see me (I have no prejudice against anyone's beliefs or practices but this would have meant more waiting and I already felt like I was a burden to her at this point). I began to cry because the reason for my visit was a decline in my mental well being and overwhelming stress, in which this instance with Dr. Baig reprimanding her receptionist was causing me more stress. I asked the receptionist and Dr. Baig to destroy my file because I would be seeing a new doctor. About thirty minutes after I left I received a call from Dr. Baig's office and it was Dr. Baig herself. She apologized for acting in that matter, saying she had not used the restroom since the morning and she was very stressed out. I have this voicemail on my phone and I am willing to share it if needed. I find this extremely inappropriate to say as a mental health specialist, especially since I am a teacher and understand that I cannot blame my actions in front of a classroom of students for simple reasons such as not using the restroom. I felt all of Dr. Baig's actions were extremely inappropriate and now I am frantically trying to find a new mental health provider to refill my current prescription and now to help me overcome the stress of my current situation and the situation I encountered with Dr. Baig. As a mental health provider, Dr. Baig should be much more aware of her actions and the way she communicates with her staff, especially in front of a brand new patient. I will be making my insurance aware of Dr. Baig's behavior so that they may consider taking her off the list of in network providers because I would not want anyone else to have to endure that kind of behavior. I would like confirmation that Dr. Baig has been made aware of this situation and hopefully reprimanded for how the situation unfolded.\n\nI will be posting this on as many public forums as possible.

I had to get the guys some food since they were nonstop, needless to say, they keep'd moving, and knocked it out. Would I recommend them?

STRIKE ONE, buddy. When a man brings his lady shopping, it's because he wants her final approval on all items before purchasing to ensure that he has not been talked into buying a clown suit.

Mainly on the second floor, next to TAM of Nevada is the ABC Bartending school. It may be confusing at first, but its convenient. I did like the fact that next door was TAM of Nevada, where we don't have to go far to get our TAM card. It is a small area, but it is big enough for 8 bartenders to be up and learning at the same time. Of course, classes may be at least doubled, or even less then 8 bartenders. But they do have classes every week. You can take one week, 6 hours a day, or you can two weeks, 3 hours a day. Its depends on your schedule, and they do have classes in the morning, afternoon and evening. \n\nMy experience, I took the two weeks course in the afternoon. I thought it would be cool to check out the Bartending world, and see if I could get my foot in the door some where. So I tried it, I got a chance to learn a lot of drink making, get some hints on how to remember drinks. Figuring out the pouring and understanding which glass is for which drink. Also understanding the job duties of the bartender, what not to do, and what is expected of you, either by opening the bar or closing the bar. All that is taught to you during your schooling. You will also get some index cards to keep, so you can always refer to drinks, either that you forgotten or just making sure your doing it correctly. After your schooling, you can always come back and practice and be able to get job leads that will help you in the right direction. \n\nI know some schools may teach flairing, or how to juggle a bottle in a fancy way. But this school is focusing on making drinks, which I like about. I know other schools may have their own method, but ABC Bartending makes sure you get a good understanding of your job duties. You can probably learn flairing on your own time, but not all casinos or bars allow flair. \n\nI would recommend this, if you really want to get an understanding on making drinks and trying to get into the Bartending world. If you don't mind the confined space, but if you think about it, some places are confined to small working area.

Being that NTK had made the top 25 restaurants in the burgh, i had to try it. So we made a rez and headed over.\n\nLet's start by saying it is in an interesting neighborhood.  They are rehabbing lots of houses so there is some other activity on the street.  But it is a teenie tiny little house converted to a restaurant.\n\nWhen you enter, you will look at those front steps and think \"it's not too late to turn around\" - but ignore the cracked steps and keep going.\n\nThen you enter the house and walk down a long hallway when you think \"i should have turned around at the steps\" but keep walking.\n\nWhen they seat you, you immediately realize that you are in a tiny little dining room and it is rather cozy.\n\nAnd then - the menu comes.  Wow. Just wow.  Yeah, they have pad thai. and they have curry. and they have rad na noodles. and then they have lots of other choices - vegetarian, thai-hesitant (for those who don't like thai or are fearful of thai), and just some really really cool dishes.\n\nSo here goes the rundown of what was ordered.\n\nThe appetizer dog choice was the fresh spring rolls. So how do you differentiate yourself from the competition?  Slice them into manageable chunks so that they can be shared easily and dipped into that Yummy  dipping sauce.\n\nI start with me as I can't rave enough about what I had.  Phar Luck Chicken.  it was a plate of steamed veggies (gr beans, snow peas, broccoli) covered with rice noodles, chicken breasts that were lightly spiced, then a peanut sauce on top.  I ordered a level 5 not knowing how it would be as one restaurant's 5 is another one's 3or 7.  Veggies were nicely steamed and crisp.  The chicken was mildly spiced atop a bed of noodles. And finished with a medium spiced peanut sauce. Just enough to taste but not over soaked.  And the surprise?  Two shrimps and some lump crabmeat.\n\nOk chef - one comment here. I loved the seafood but I know not everyone can eat that so including something that can trigger an allergic reaction without disclosing it can lead to disaster. And no customer would ever assume to ask about shrimp in a chicken dish.  Maybe add it to the description or have waitstaff mention it when it is ordered?\n\nDH had green curry with chicken.  Lots of veggies, nicely spiced but nothing out of the ordinary.  It was good but maybe not as strong of a curry taste as he was used to.  But it held its own with the other Thai restaurants.\n\nDSS had crab pineapple fried rice.  Ok. Seriously. How could you not love that combo. It took self-restraint on my part to not just grab that plate from him. Now THAT was an unusual combo I have never seen elsewhere and according to DSS, it was great (first sign of a good dish?  No offers to share :)\n\nOur server was excellent.  Never was a water glass empty.  plates were removed promptly. We were never rushed as we lingered in conversation.  \n\nSo this is now added to my \"places to visit when back in the burgh\" list.\n\n\n7/16. Update.\nI decided while back in the burgh again on business to revisit NTK.  I ordered takeout to nibble back at the hotel.  A few comments. \n1.  The Phar Luck was as good as I remembered.  Yum again\n2.  I passed on an appetizer so I could Try their sticky rice with custard.  Imagine my surprise when I opened it and discovered black sticky rice....oh my....wow.  Topped with a square of creamy smooth custard topped with coconut.  Again the little details that make NTK just stand out from the pack.\n3.  I was surprised to be charged a surcharge for a takeout order.  Seriously? Each item was marked up for the privilege of saving them the salary they pay their waitstaff when I took the food out. No, it is not a big deal (a little over 10% or so). Again, disclosure would have been nice. Or no surcharge at all.\n4.  Speaking of takeout, chef, how about using some of that surcharge to pay for decent plastic ware? I don't do chopsticks and found that it was impossible to spear the steamed veggies with those dollar store forks. Since I was in a hotel without a kitchen, that was the only fork I had and when it snapped in the broccoli....well....let's just say it wasn't pretty.

On a Thursday afternoon where the store was not even busy, it took me a while just to flag someone down to get help on finding a certain item. First, I was pointed to the wrong section. After searching unsuccessfully, I was redirected to a completely different section where I did find the item I was looking for.  At the cashier, I was asked if I had the Rewards card to which I replied yes. However, the lady completed the transaction without scanning my Rewards card for points. I was directed to Customer Service to get the points and this was when things got rather frustrating. I only had the barcode on my phone and they couldn't easily scan my card. They tried looking me up using my phone number but was unsuccessful and I told them I don't buy from BestBuy that often. The salesperson then said, \"There's no point to collect the points then since they expire in 6 months anyway.\"   I said, \"I still want to collect the points. Who knows maybe I'll make a bigger purchase in the next few months.\"  He kept saying there is no point 'cause the points will become zero anyway if I didn't reach 400pts in 6 months. By that time, I was just too frustrated to deal with that guy and left.  Later when I read about he Rewards Program on their website, it says the points only expire in 1 YEAR if no eligible purchase is made during that time.  \n\nThe salesperson was basically telling me the Rewards Program is useless so don't bother.  Whether I end up redeeming my points or not is not the main issue.  I was entitled to those points based on their Rewards Program. I felt the salesperson tried  to brush me off 'cause he couldn't be bothered to spend a bit more time to correct the mistake made by the cashier.

Further to that, it was dry and tasted like it had been cooked over a gasoline flame. Yuk!  This place is great if you have no idea what the offerings are supposed to taste like.

The owner acknowledged that this solution would be expensive for him, but stated that he could not refund me for the service I received unless they undid the service. I didn't have any other obligations so I went ahead and had them remove the gel polish and replace it with regular. The owner refunded me for the gel polish and credited my card for the amount that was put in my customer loyalty card. I originally rated the business 1 star, based on my previous review.

Lesson learned! I will not return or recommend them. I was quoted $30 for a fill and $20 for a basic pedicure. I planned on spending $50 total after the discount and adding a 20% tip. I chose my colors for both fingernails and toenails. Nobody ever mentioned an extra charge for gel polish. The nail fill was basic. I did get cut by the drill under two nails and they bled. The pedicure was okay, but the water could have been a lot warmer. I have had much more relaxing pedicures for the same cost. Once finished, I was charged $76. $36 more than I had planned to spend (not counting the tip). Yikes!

When I inquired about the overcharge, I was given an extensive, complicated brochure with details on all of the service charges including \"additional services\" that are tacked onto the normal services. For example, there is an $18 charge for gel polish on toenails, a $5 charge for french tip, and a $13 charge for gel polish on acrylic nails! There's the $36 extra charge.

I also have Medicare and AARP. I looked at my husband's bill from last year and noticed the name of the clinic changed. Beware- this place was taken over by Banner recently. His new patient visit cost was $175.00 last year. My new patient visit this year was billed at $273.00. My second visit was less- $271.00! Plus tests, etc. When I called billing, the girl said they never billed my secondary and needed to resubmit. Really....... the bill clearly said Insurance payments already received and my portion was $488.00. I'm glad I called. Beware though- their charges are much higher than the clinic that was there in the past.\nUpdate- MEDICARE PATIENTS BEWARE!

When we got there and they told us there will be a little wait because the table was occupied and that table was not done eating yet and we should be sat right when they left. We were ok with waiting a bit, about 15 minutes later they asked if they can move us to a different table, smaller than the one they were going to put us in because that smaller table would be finished before our original table would be done. We agreed, but it was awkward having a group of ten people waiting inside, while people walked in and out. 10 minutes later the hostess offered us the back patio that we can be seated right away and they will put on the misters on back there for us. We agreed because we wanted to sit and get out of the way. My fiance was not happy about the move outside. The waiters were prompt with our drink orders when we sat, but never came back to check on us after that. I think they might have forgotten us, because about 45 minutes later two waiters came out and apologized and they gave us a couple of free appetizers.

About half way into eating our meal, the waiter asked if she could box up our meals? I thought it was odd, but told her we are still working on our dinner. About ten minutes later the waiter came out and asked us who was on what bill so she could split them, we let her know and she left. She came back with our bills and told us no hurry and left. I did not think much of it until, a different waiter came out and approached my fiance telling him that our reservation time had expired and we needed to leave because another group was waiting for our table! He was not very polite to her when she pretty much told us to leave. I was so upset that I didn't even wanted to say anymore. They changed our reservation table 3 times and now they are telling us to leave because someone else is waiting for our table, I couldn't believe it.

Mexican/Asian fusion sounds awesome, their dishes sound great, and it's right up my alley as far as flavors go. We tried 4 things - the bacon-wrapped dates, the suzuki roll, the fried plantains and the Mexican pho. \n\nThe bacon-wrapped dates are really, really good. There's not a lot of cheese flavor in them, but it doesn't really matter. The foie gras sauce is perfect with them. I have no idea what these have to do with Asian cuisine or Mexican cuisine, but I don't think I care.\nThe plantains were fine, though a bit underseasoned. \nThe Suzuki roll was...odd. The flavor itself was somewhat bland, even with the sauce, and the texture of the crust just didn't work. Coming from Seattle I knew that ordering the sushi was going to be a hit or miss thing, but it really just wasn't that great.\nThe big disappointment for me was the pho. I love pho, and I was really hoping for something special here. As it was, it didn't taste like, really, anything special. There was no good anise or meaty flavor that you get from pho, there wasn't any kind of spiciness or interesting flavor like you get from pozole or menudo. The meat was overcooked and tough, the broth a bit bland, and the noodles soggy and not great. \n\nAgain, the restaurant itself looks incredible, and  I wouldn't hesitate to bring a date there - don't bring kids, and do dress up.

Included in that message it states \"As disclosed by the coupon company at the time of your purchase, 10% gratuity, based off original full price value price of $485 is expected and appreciated.\" Please plan this. I have never in my life ever been told by anyone how much they expect to be tipped - I find this rude and greedy. It made me wonder if she would do a subpar job to get me in for the retouch, thus costing me an additional $50 for the tip and $75 for the touch up. And of course it was subpar. Then in her email she goes on to say that if you do this she will give you 50% off the $150 touch up price. Well first of all Groupon stated no such thing. Being last minute and on a tight budget as mentioned I only had half the tip. I told her I would mail her the other half. So a week later I told her I wanted to mail her the final tip and qualify for the 50% off retouch for $75. Her response was \"great send it to such and such and address. And wait 6 wks for the retouch\". I am still waiting for her to confirm the $75 retouch fee and so I resend the question asking her to confirm, and also asked what suite she was in. She slides right by my question about the discount, but gives me the suite # she is in. At this point even more flags are going up.  I finally said why didn't you answer my question about $75 retouch?  She slid in a sly comment about saying great we will see you there. But, no confirmation on the discount!  It was like pulling teeth it was so ridiculous the game she was playing. Then I said all I wanted was you to confirm it was only $75 you would be charging me - just didn't want any surprises. \"Then she says to me - Yes, I normally offer it at the time of the appointment or if payment is received right away but I have no problem extending that to you, I will watch the mail\". At this point I don't trust her. Ok, so here is what happened at the appt. I had my eyebrow pencil on. A darker chocolate brown. I told her I wanted my eyebrows just a little lighter than the eyebrow pencil. So she puts this putty looking color on my forehead and said \"how's this?\" I said that looks pretty light, I want it just slightly lighter than my eyebrow pencil. She said it would be. I said you are the pro, I believe you. Well they are way to light and one is shorter than the other. The shape came out ok for the most part. But after dealing with her business wise and our text messages I do not trust her at all. I know if I did not push the confirmation of the 50% discount, I would have had my retouch and she would have said \"That will be $150\" I guarantee you, she is sly. But not sly enough - it took me 3 times trying to get her to answer my question and then when she finally did, she said she normally only offers it immediately but would extend it to me - She is a piece of work. Be careful and know exactly what you should be getting, because she will try not to give it to you - just like she did to me.

I was turned off immediately due to the lack of response at the server/check in station. The serving station is set up so that the servers' backs are faced to you. We didn't know who we were to check in with and when my mom attempted to, she was ignored numerous times.

Il faut une heure au restaurant pour faire un tour complet mais honn\u00eatement vous ferez \u00e0 coup sur un tour.\n\nLe concept de restaurant est sympa et en plus de cela il s'agit d'un buffet unique pour un prix relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9 de 60dollars par personnes (sans les taxes). Je pense que l'on paye un peu la vue mais pas uniquement. Le service est vraiment agr\u00e9able, r\u00e9actif et digne d'un grand restaurant (enfin presque). Cot\u00e9 nourriture comme il s'agit d'un buffet il et difficile de vous dire tout ce qui est disponible mais on y trouve en entr\u00e9 des salades, du homard, du saumon et d'autres produit divers et vari\u00e9s. La partie entr\u00e9e est la seule qui se trouve sur la partie tournante et qui est donc toujours  au m\u00eame endroit par rapport \u00e0 bous. Par contre du fait de la rotation du restaurant vous ne bougerez pas en m\u00eame temps que les plats et dessert et des fois c'est d\u00e9concertant de faire tout le tour pour trouver son plat et retrouver sa table. \n\nPour les plats il y a un large choix de plat chaud ou de pattes faites \u00e0 la commande avec pleins de recettes diff\u00e9rentes. Pour la qualit\u00e9 rien \u00e0 redire et tout est maintenu au chaud. Il en est de m\u00eame pour le fromage et les dessert puisque le buffet vous laisse une grande libert\u00e9 de choix et d'assortiment.\nC'est bien joli de parler de la nourriture dans un restaurant mais cela ne fait pas tout. Par exemple la d\u00e9coration est totalement horrible avec de la moquette par terre et des \" \u0153uvres \" d'art \u00e0 certains endroit qui laissent perplexe.

I then immediately went home and came all the way back to the shop with the correct piece within that hour. The same man then gave me a ticket to pick up my purse when it was ready. He took my purse, held the broken piece I brought him in his hand, and told me it will be ready by tomorrow. The man did not give me a time to come so I gave him more than 24 hours (28 hours to be precise). \n\nThe next day, I came to pick up my purse. I walked in and pulled out the ticket the man gave me the day before, and I gave it to the woman working there. She took the ticket and looked at me clueless, and asked what I came for. The point of providing a ticket is so that they can match it up with the item they have for me. I had to explain to the lady what it was exactly that I was picking up. She was digging through other purses as I could see from where I was standing. I had to point out to her where my purse was. It was still sitting in the same bag I gave the man the day I dropped it off. She pulled my purse out of the bag by the broken handle and stared at me in a way of what is she supposed to do about it. I calmly explained to her that the man that took my purse said it will be fixed by tomorrow. She then gave the purse to another man that was working there that I had not seen the previous day when I dropped off my purse. The lady walked to the counter and completely ignored me, then began to help another customer.

The man replied and said \"He's not here!\" I then asked \"when will he be in next?\" and the man replied \"Tomorrow morning!\" in a very aggressive manner and tone\". The man was legitimately yelling at me saying the other guy was not there and \"what do you want me to do?!?!\" Followed by his impatient non-caring belligerence, I told him in the calmest way \"You know, you shouldn't talk to your customers that way\". He then began to fumble words together, explaining the guy that helped me will not be in anymore and saying he is going to get rid of him. I was confused because he just told me he will be in the next morning. That was when I said \"I don't understand\". Then the man said \"You know what?! Take the purse somewhere else!! Don't come back here\". He also said \"I don't like customers talking to me that way!!\" Followed by my response (keeping my cool) \"How am I talking to you?\" He did not respond. Instead, he said \"Give me the ticket back!\" I explained I already gave the woman the ticket, not realizing she gave it back to me. I opened my wallet and was searching for the ticket and he saw it and stuck his hands near my wallet to show me, and I still didn't see it. The second before I found it and was about to pull it out, he was about to pull it out for me, almost invading my privacy. He kept fumbling and yelling, telling me to get out and go somewhere else.

It's been months since I had my first and only visit here.  After my experience, I took the time to write some notes so that when I finally got around to it I could have these details for my review.  So here it is:\n\nI saw \"Crystal\" I believe her name was.  Up to this point I'd had gel on my nails constantly for months so I wanted regular polish to give my nails a break.  Listen, when I go somewhere to pay for a service, I know what I want.  I don't need anyone to try and up-sell me over and over again.  So her constant questioning me, \"You don't want gel?\" \"You sure you don't want gel?\" was flipping annoying.    \n\nThe pedicure turned out fine although the massage was barely there. The manicure on the other hand was a disaster in the making.  Normally when techs remove your gel polish, they let it sit for 10 minutes so the acetone soaks in and softens up the old gel polish so it can be scraped off w/o damage to the nail bed.  This gal \"Crystal\" lets my fingertips sit in a bowl for barely 10 seconds and then proceeds to use a Dremel sanding tool on me, sanding off the layers of old gel polish. I didn't realize at the time the damage she was doing.  There were points where it felt \"hot\" on my nails, and I knew she was going at it too harsh but I didn't say anything because I thought this was a new technique or something (after all, she's the \"professional\", right?).  I didn't imagine she was actually damaging me and SANDING OFF LAYERS OF MY NAILS!\n\nWell, needless to say the end result was rough, uneven, lumpy, full-of-grooves, thinned nails!!!  Which of course means weaker nails that split and crack.  Which is exactly what happened for the next course of months as I had to let them grow out.  She even tried to cheat me out of 2 coats of regular nail polish, since she wasn't pulling in the \"big\" money with a gel mani.  \"There look, only 1 coat is okay!\".  I said, \"Seriously?  No, I want two coats\".  Who does that?!??!!\n\nNever again will I go there, and never again will I second guess myself when a technician pulls one of those Dremel sanders out.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "Womp, womp.

Came in about ten minutes after they just opened for breakfast on a Sunday with no reservations. We were easily accommodated as we were one of the first few there. Tip: if you do go later in the am, I recommend making reservations. By the time we were done eating, the restaurant was a lot more full.\n\nWe were fortunate enough to get seated with one of the best views in the conservatory. The lighting is beautiful, decor-very clean and pristine, and the view of the outdoor pool alongside cabanas makes you feel like you're not in Vegas. When the weather permits, I'm sure the outdoor area would be ideal.\n\nOrdered the Tableau breakfast, duck hash & eggs, and white chocolate orange fresh toast.

A pastry basket accompanies the Tableau breakfast that came with two palmiers, two blueberry muffins, and two pineapple pastries. They were okay. I, personally, ordered the duck hash & eggs and my favorite part about it was probably the pastry layer on the bottom. There was ample amount of duck, potatoes, topped with scrambled eggs and roasted tomato hollandaise sauce. Portion size is just right but I still did not finish mine as I found it too gamey and overwhelming to my palate after eating half of it. Also, I didn't taste much tomato flavor in the hollandaise sauce. Sorry! I know a lot of people on here raved about it but I guess it just didn't cater to my taste buds. The white chocolate orange french toast garnished with blueberries and orange slices was good but the white chocolate was too subtle that it tasted more like orange. \n\nOverall, this place is just alright. Our initial server was not the friendliest and she seemed annoyed by our indecisiveness. Food was ok and during our time here, we felt very uptight and as if we needed to be on our best behaviors.

We were seated at a booth that had crumbs covering the seats, and then sat at our table for probably 15 minutes before our server came over. We ordered our drinks and chips & salsa ($3/not free). Our server checked for us that we could get the specialty on-the-rocks margaritas in the souvenir cactus cups, and gave us the price before putting it on, which was nice. My boyfriend's was gonna be $46, and he said okay, but to make It strong, and they absolutely did. The bartending got this place an extra star. It took a very long time for them to come out, which makes sense given our special request, but once they did (we could see them sitting at the server counter from our seats), our server passed by them three times without grabbing them until we flagged her down. \n\nWe got steak and chicken fajitas, and the steak was more medium-well than medium-rare, and I didn't care for it much. The chicken had good seasoning and was cooked properly, so that was better. My boyfriend got the trio dish which came with a chicken enchilada (okay-basically a pile of mush without much flavor), a pork tamale (disgusting . . . really disgusting. It looked identical to the enchilada, but I can't even describe how gross it was), and a mini taco (okay).  \n\nThey forgot our corn tortillas and we asked or server, but then forgot and we had to remind her again ten minutes later once we could finally flag her down. I felt bad for the table next to us at one point, because after we reminded her a second time for the tortillas and a refill on a soda, she turned to them when they were about to place an order, then realized she forgot the tortillas and for them, then turned to take their order again, then realized one of our sodas were empty and refilled it, then finally actually took their order. Happy to be served, but that was pretty chaotic.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend visiting the bar, only, and maybe even pass on the chips and salsa, since I don't feel they're really worth the $3.

We initially consulted Gentle Journey for a hospice visit, and our pet was uncharacteristically upbeat that day.

The vet she referred us to was amazing ( Midwestern University Veterinary Clinic Dr Foy which should be another review in and of itself), but unfortunately the full diagnosis turned out to be something that wasn't curable ( a rare hepatic carcinoma) and our dog declined rapidly thereafter.  I appreciated the consult to get further testing to make sure our dog had a terminal illness, as well as tips to help our dog eat, and the advice to let us know when the time was right for euthanasia. When the time came to put him down, the same vet (Dr. Boisjolie) came, and  was extremely thoughtful and caring during the whole process.  I found it convenient that they offered online scheduling which allowed me to know that times were available when the tough decision came. They also have a phone number for same day appointments, but we were able to schedule online for the same day.  I know a previous review was a little off put over the questions regarding weight, driving distance, and time of day, but unfortunately those are all factors for someone who is going to come to your own house and provide a service that is much better for your loved one being done in a familiar environment than a stressful place like a vet office. I have had to put down previous pets, and before I went to the vet office. I will say it is much more peaceful, and less traumatic to do it at your home.

The three floors of space mean that there's plenty of space to meet with friends or go for dinner with the family (kids are welcome until 9 pm as per AGLC regulations). While each floor has large bar area with plenty of taps for 'beers to come', each differs in style. \nThe first thing you notice when you walk in the main level front door is the super cool, mesmerizing overhead conveyor belt upon which empty growlers weave their way throughout the main floor seating area before disappearing to the basement level where all the cool kids go (because there's a hot bartender...I'm looking at you beardy man!). The main bar is situated along the far wall and the seating is comfortable and not too packed together. The street level patio area will be the perfect spot to sip beer while people watching.\nDownstairs, there's a large U shaped bar with seating and the surrounding tables. It's dark, it's a bit quieter, and it has peek a boo windows into the ladies toilets. Don't worry, you're not exposed...but you do have a view of the brewing tanks!\nThe very top floor is more of a 'dining area' with large yellow padded booths and a gorgeous bar-style seating area overlooking the avenue. It's the perfect place for people watching without having to inhale the smoke from ground floor level sidewalk smokers. \nI'm not going to comment on the menu, so far as to say it is quite extensive with the most expected gastropub dishes available (burgers, pizza, poutine). I am predicting that the house favourites will be the more meaty smoke house options like the 12 hour brisket and wonderful pulled pork. I like that Alberta grown/produced items are marked as 'AB' on the menu and that they already have two mealshare items.\nLast, but certainly not least, let's talk beer. There is currently no beer brewing at T5 but the owners, PJ Hereaux  L'Heureux, Ernie Tsu, and Wayne Leong were able to rent brewing space at Tool Shed Brewery in order to brew Trolley 5's very first beers; the Derailed Pale Ale, and First Crush IPA. They were also able to collaborate with Parallel 49 to create Cowboy Crusher (It's a Stampede thing) and local brewers Last Best Brewing to create the Downtown Dunkel Dunkelweizen.

We went in and per usual, a very enthusiastic salesperson came up to greet us. He was just the right amount of 'helpful,' not hovering too much and not absent. We picked out a set we liked and went to the back to set up financing. The GE Capital remote financing system was down for the day so the staff took my information and said they would call me if I wasn't approved.\n\nFast (pun intended) forward to 3 weeks later when they finally were able to deliver the set. I was the first stop on the delivery route which was nice however the delivery people seemed to be in a huge rush. They made me sign a waiver stating that I would not claim damages if they were to damage my house or the furniture itself. They quickly got the loveseat and recliner upstairs but struggled a little with the sofa.  After scratching up the paint on my walls and gouging marks in my drywall, they quickly set it down in front of my front door and told me they couldn't get it up there and said that I would need to call customer service to get a refund.\n\nSo I did just that, I called Customer Service to say that I needed a refund and that I needed to schedule a pick up. Customer Service then told me to call the store I bought it from to receive the refund. Okay, fine. I called the store who seemed less than pleased to give me my refund, explaining that it didn't fit and that I would also need to schedule a pick up. They told me that they would then charge me $80 since I didn't refuse the furniture at the time they dropped it off.  Um, last I checked no one, including the delivery men, told me I had the right to refuse at that point and I wouldn't have to pay the $80.  By this point I just want the sofa out of my house and the money returned, so I agree to pay the $80 delivery fee and am told that Customer Service will call me to schedule a pick up.\n\nA week and a half goes by and no call from Customer Service. So I call the store to explain that I haven't received a call from Customer Service and need to know what I need to do to get a pick-up scheduled. I was transferred to someone at the store who was extremely rude on the phone and told me that I needed to call Customer Service.  I asked her if there was anything I needed to tell Customer Service (like an order number or ticket) and she said \"I guess...\" \n\nI call Customer Service by this point (sorry this story is so long) and am extremely frustrated. I am really nice and completely appreciate people in any kind of service industry so I explain why I am frustrated and want to know how I can just get this sofa out of my house. The Customer Service rep asked me if I had disputed the $80 service charge or anything like that and when I responded 'no' she said she was confused why no one had called to schedule my pick up appointment (you and me both, friend). So we set up the pick up appointment for 2 and a half weeks out because that was the earliest time they had!\n\nBy now my fiancee, who isn't quite as patient, called the store to ask why we weren't provided with better customer service. When the salesperson who answered the phone wasn't giving any answers, he asked to speak to the manager. The manager on staff was extremely rude and sarcastic. Along the way we had told all the salespeople that we just moved into a new home and are wanting to buy 2 new beds, a new sofa to replace the one that was too large, and an additional recliner.  That could be more than $3k in sales to them!  They refused to return the $80 delivery charge unless we purchased a brand new item on the phone right then so my fiancee just rented a uhaul truck, drove the sofa to the Ashley warehouse, and dropped it off.\n\nI am still in the midst of waiting for the $80 delivery charge to be credited to my account.

There is no way to pay online without being charged $7 per transaction. By far, the most annoying thing since we live in the 21st century.\n- Gramercy is one of the more expensive apartment complexes in the area, as it is newer.

And for the most part, Chef Paul and his supremely professional delivered. Our group of 12 was seated at perhaps the best location in the entire place-the center cabana by the pool...which allowed us to view the entire restaurant through the glass doors and enjoy a  panoramic view of the poolside restaurant as well. \n\nOur group opted for the top level chef tasting menu which includes a variety of shellfish (and of course the coveted langoustines which are tagged and monitored from ocean to table), a pasta course, the main fish course and a family style dessert tasting. If you've never dined here, pay close attention to the presentation at the beginning. It is obvious they take great care to source their Mediterranean Sea creatures and fly them in over no more than 48hrs. They also stress that the food is not fancy...it is just super fresh and prepared and served in a homey more rustic preparation. That said, your taste buds will sing after feasting on the octopus, scallops, barnacles, shrimp and super sweet langoustines. Our pasta course featured a penne with seafood in a red sauce, a gorgeous pappardelle with mushrooms, the signature cheese ravioli which were so delicate they melt in your mouth and my favorite-a squid ink risotto which was knock your socks off good. I am not a huge fan of pasta in general but it is hard not to appreciate the deft hand and the al Dente preparations here. In case you're still hungry, they filleted sizable John Dory table side which is presented in this beautiful thick salt crust. And boy is that fish flakey white and simply delicious. \n\nThe dessert course was really overwhelming but we all forced ourselves to taste a bite of each- sorbetto and gelato, a berry compote panna cotta, an olive oil cake doused in rum, a chocolate mouse of sorts and my pick-the semifreddo on a chocolate cookie crust with a dried prune topping-sensational. \n\nThe wine list is impressive and we deferred to the sommelier for some Italian selections. Here is a tip: bottle prices can climb quickly but if you stick with the ones recommended for under $100 each you won't go wrong...promise. \n\nService was absolutely fantastic. Attentive, knowledgable and friendly. If you appreciate what Chef Paul has done with this exquisite seafood Mecca then the tab shouldn't surprise you. Fabulous food in a gorgeous setting served by the most professional staff..and the portions will absolutely fill your belly.

I had faithfully gone to my dentist in Tempe every 6 months for as long as I've had teeth. I've never had a cavity or any problems at all really, though they had said I had borderline gingivitis and gave me suggestions for improving my brushing habits. Enter Waterfront Dentistry...I only went because I \"won\" a free teeth whitening at the Phoenix Bridal Show. I hadn't been worried about the color of my teeth, but it's free so why not? The staff at Waterfront were pleasant enough and there was impressive high tech equipment, but the dentist was very alarmed at how much recession I had in my gums. He said I might need grafting surgery, but he recommended a revolutionary cutting edge treatment that only he does (~$700). And he did not recommend whitening because he thought it would be too painful for me. So I didn't get the whitening, instead, all I acquired was insecurity and fear about my teeth which I'd never had before. I visited my regular dentist a month later and he asked me questions like \"is it bothering you?\" and when I said no, he recommended keeping an eye on it if the recession progresses, but it's nothing to worry about. I've since moved to Oregon and met a new dentist who has confirmed the perspective of brushing carefully, but nothing major is needed at this stage.\n\nMy experience with Waterfront was over 2 years ago now. Perhaps there's been a change in management  but as of December 2012, I'm convinced Waterfront made their money preying on the insecurities of brides.

Not saying that it for sure had anything to do with the service I received, but unfortunately these are things you notice when you are the only patron receiving poor service. But onto the food. The float was pretty good, nothing to knock your socks off. I really enjoyed the chicken. However, the fried pickles left me soooo disappointed. For one, I prefer a cornmeal breading on my fried pickles, and it seems they use the same flour batter on the chicken and the pickles. Also the pickles are sweet pickles, which was really off. The sweetness just didn't mesh well with the seasonings in the batter for me. And the flour batter didn't stick very well the pickles. I think the pickles may have been too wet going in. It was just the wrong flavors and consistency all over.\n\nOverall, this place really disappointed me. Mainly due to poor service the entire time.

You have to book way ahead of time if you want a rental on-hand so I was stuck with the shuttle. It was functional but I still needed to get myself from work to home without their help. Most dealers don't have rentals available at all so I wouldn't score this as a too much of a negative quality\n\nTheir service agents are a little overworked and that caused them to miss something I wanted them to inspect for the first service. It was minor, just checking the parking brake, but I wish they had more service reps on hand so they could pay more attention to the clients.

I am not paying them to be nice-- I am paying them to cook me some awesome grub.\n\nThe best sandwich, to me, is the Italiano because it's the best prosciutto I have ever had.  The texture and quality makes it melt in your mouth.  Also, you can have this sandwich on focaccia (my friends usually choose this option) or the homemade Italian bread, which is my choice.  It's soft and that dusting of flour just makes me all Italo-happy.  It's served with uber-fresh basil as well.  There is a balsamic dressing that is usally served on top, but I ask for it on the side, as I don't like my bread to get mushy.  Finally, the sandwich is pretty big, so it's worth the $10.  (It's gotta be $10 worth of primo prosciutto alone!)\n\nThe other key choice is the pizza.  I departed from my beloved Italiano one day (but only because I had already eaten it 2 days before) and ventured toward the pizza.  I am suprised to say that it's really great!  The crust is perfect, and it's just the right amount of doughy.\n\nMy advice is to try it.  Get there at 11:30am or 1:00pm for lunch.  Carpool.  Bring cash.  Smell the air when you walk in.

I will start by saying that I have been going to Agave Spa for at least the last 4 years for haircut and highlights.  I have always received nothing but awesome service.  However, for the last year, it appears their good employees are not there anymore.  Not sure if management has changed, but how the place is managed is reminiscent of a strip mall joint, from the incompetency of booking an appointment, the ineptitude of the technicians, and the inability to provide good customer service.  \n\nMy last experience about 4 months ago was just OK.  Not great color (she kind of messed it up), but somewhat fixed it and gave me a good hair cut.  Came back second week of Dec 2014 at a futile attempt to get my highlights back on track and a haircut.  First of all, they booked my appointment at the not agreed time (who books a haircut before highlights?).  I was taking time off from work and until now have never had an issue.  Well, no apologies for that.  Came in at my appointment time, which was 30 minutes after they had booked it, with a different person from last time.  Technician right away told me she was not going to have time to complete my appointment and should plan to come back at another time.  After a discussion of what I wanted and what she wanted to do, we proceeded with her way, which I pointed out several times that I was hesitant because no one in the past had ever done hightlights in that manner - basically, a tint in the roots - and that was it.  All this time she kept looking at her watch, rushing, hands trembling, not a pleasant spa experience.  \n\nI have long light brown hair with natural highlights, which I like to accentuate with additional highlights, leaving as much of my natural hair color as possible.  Once the processing was complete, my roots came out blonde red !!!  I just wanted to cry.  She insisted that when they dried out they will be fine.  Really?  I don't think so.  Red is red.  After going back and forth, she conceded it was somewhat red-toned.  After leaving me in the chair for another 15 min to consult with someone else, they came back to attempt to fix the red with a toner.  \n\nWell, while my hair was being toned down, the next appointment showed up.  My technician started to rush and did a mediocre job at rinsing (with water only) the chemicals out.  Granted that at least the hair toned down in bright red, but I will bet that when my brown color will start coming out I will see this noticeable dark root contrasting with this blonde red color.  Exactly what I wanted to avoid and hence why I only wanted some hightlights to blend in with my brown hair, as I have done for years.  Well, came back to her chair and she said that this was all she could do for me today, and would not have time to dry me out or anything as her next appointment was already waiting.\n\nShe escorted me to the front desk, hair dripping, with a gel-like substance in my ears, back of my ears, back of my head, and my head still stinging.  I was dripping all over the place (have long hair) and my shirt was completely soaked.   Front desk said that because she could not dry me out they will give me a 10% discount.  They still collected the 20% gratuity off the original price.  \n\nAfter leaving, I had to come straight home and take a shower as that gel thing was all over my head and I was reaking of chemical smell that was burning me.  I just started crying after looking at my hair.  And of course, no haircut.  I have Holiday parties to attend, leaving town for Christmas, and now looking at the prospect of bad hair during the Holiday season.  Unacceptable.  Literally, my look is that of having done a supermarket color kit on myself.  At work the next day, my co-workers asked incredulously that they thought I was getting highlights the day before.  No one even mentioned my hair looked OK.  Complete silence.  Now I felt even worse.\n\nIn conclusion, I made an appointment for highlights and hair cut, and got neither.

The poppers were filled with cream cheese and salmon with a tempura batter. The calamari were okay as well, but the breading was disappointingly flavorless, much like the chicken wings. The dipping sauce that came with it added some much needed flavor to the dish.\n\nThe service was relatively spotty. We were seated immediately and our waiter took our order quickly.

It's a very nice looking restaurant with attentive and helpful staff members, but mediocre food. Which is exactly the opposite of what I was expecting from an Iron Chef flagship restaurant. \n\nThe food is \"alright\". The restaurant serves a variety of unique dishes you won't find anywhere else. They offer anything from lamb, to tomato watermelon salad, to fried marrow. For a chef of such prestige with a price point of about $150/person for dinner, the quality of the food is lackluster. There's little to no attention to detail in Lola's cuisine. They're churning out low flavor meals from a cookie cutter recipe book over and over again and using their notoriety as a supplement for effort. You're paying to eat in a nicely decorated restaurant made by a celebrity, definitely not for the food quality. It's food you'd expect from a local restaurant for maybe $50 a person and I wasn't \"wowed\" by a single dish. \n\nLola does have an extensive drink menu which they present to you on an iPad, which I understand because it changes so often, but there's something about waiting for each drink to slowly load that really dispels any resemblance of fine dining. As a die-hard red wine fan, I was a bit disappointed to not see anything that caught my eye or seemed worth the significant price mark-up. The cocktails were the highlight of the experience. I ordered their pistachio rose cocktail and I'd happily go back again and just order the drink. \n\nThe deserts were fairly impressive. I ordered the Peppermint Patty and by dinner companion ordered the Cheat Day. Both were very rich and presented with attention to detail. Great desserts! \n\nThe hosts were extremely generous. I booked a reservation for two on OpenTable for 7:45 and unfortunately didn't arrive until closer to 8.

Being seated away from the dimly-lit loud bar area and near a the window made it a much more intimate and enjoyable experience. \n\nOur waiter, Brandon, was happy to make recommendations and was fun to talk to. He even brought out a cupcake with a personalized birthday message on the house.

But it's new(ish) to Vegas, so... deal.\n\nFarmer Boys had a unique place in my heart back home -- better than fast food, but not quite restaurant quality. It was the place you went to when you didn't really want to get gussied up for a restaurant (nobody REALLY likes to gussy, let's face it) but could go for something a little classier than Mickey D's. When I heard there was a new location relatively close to me, I was on it like Comet.\n\nNow... I understand this location hasn't been open for all that long. But the service... well, is it so much to ask that my order not be interrupted three times because you messed up on the prior order? Then go running around for a pen because you don't have one readily available? I mean, seriously, that's about the extent of your interaction with servers, so don't mess it up.\n\nAs for the food, it's still a pretty good quality. I went for the chili and cheese omelette (Ryan's Rule for Yelp Dining: Everything can be made better with chili) and it was pretty good. I've had better, but I've certainly had worse. I apologize if I sound like a broken record... broken record... broken record... but again, it was not restaurant quality, but certainly better than an Anything McAnything. Though I didn't have one this time around, I remember the burgers being pretty tasty too; I'll have to get one next time.\n\nSo this Farmer Boys location takes up the mantle I left behind in Orange County: somewhere in between a fast-food place and a real restaurant.

Well cooked seasoned chicken and as mentioned was nice and plump. Fries your regular fries, nice and crispy. Nice salad, good amount of feta, but the dressing is what tops it.

So, we check in and as they point us to the bell desk they \"failed\" to advise me that their bell staff is in the heat if a union labor dispute which prevents them from providing us bell service to our room. WTF?! The lady at the bell desk NOW informs me of this and after some pissing and moaning I get a cart; However, the guy who brought it to me was nice enough to tell me \"fuck them! I know I'm not supposed to do this but WTF is the service that you expect when you come to Vegas? It doesn't make any sense?!\" We had an enlightening discussion as I sent the wife and kids up to our room and I went with the bell guy and out luggage. Apparently, the Luxor and Excalibur are \"merging\" and the staff are getting screwed out of their tips: the valets are too apparently. Just to save a few bucks management tells the bell staff ONLY to assist the disabled and elderly; I talked with a supervisor at the front desk and she went with the political excuse that \"they cannot refuse service if you request it\" but \"they instructed their staff to ONLY assist the elderly and handicapped.\" After I pulled the \"discrimination card\" she told me this. Completely unprofessional. As we went to other hotels in the area such as the New York New York, Circus Circus, and the Luxor, it was nothing but tired folks hauling their own luggage around checking out (we went to lunch around check out time at these places) and checking in. Now, back to our hotel; we got housekeeping service 2 out if the 3 days we stayed; we came back from a fun day and I found filthy towels STILL on the floor and the room hadn't been touched. I called for towels and washcloths instead since we were leaving Sunday morning; I had to leave to catch the \"Tournament of Kings\" show downstairs (which was bad ass I should tell you).

All they gave us was the stupid door hanger \"privacy please\" which I'd expect from a Motel 6 not an upscale strip hotel. Self parking is a joke; almost had some \"parking rage\" on the 2nd night but I survived with a clean Vegas rap sheet j/k. The valets are understaffed and have major A.D.D. so there is no \"sure fire\" time to get valet. The lamp outlet in our room couldn't hold a plug, two wall outlets didn't work AT ALL.

We didn't feel as though we should have to pay for our drinks, due to the delay in service. We were told when we ordered our drinks it would be 20 minutes at the most. He said he would need to check with the manager to see if it would be all right to remove these from our tab. This added even more time. He came back and said it was fine. We tipped him a five, drank our drinks, also inspired the rest of the pool to order margaritas, and were on our way out. The next day at the pool, we ordered food. We were hoping for a better situation. The food came out in a timely manner, as well as a few more drinks. The manager Meagan came up and the polite man delivering the food, same as yesterday, named Syl came up with a manager as well. They both apologized about the delayed service and talked to us for about 10 minutes. It was a very nice gesture. There was a health & fitness convention happening at the same time, so there were a lot of people at the gym every morning and also outside, doing their own training sessions. It was motivating, but also a little bit hard to work out in the fitness center. Not sure that would always be a problem, though. We had a delicious craft cocktail at the bar-Dust Cutter downstairs.

Maybe he's jaded by fame, maybe he's tired from performing in too many shows; whatever it is, it's not worth your money. \n\nJeff was 15 minutes late (claimed technical defect).  After a slideshow of his life before fame, he then spent the next 15 minutes discussing his (significantly younger) new wife, their twins (she's 5 months preggers), her cookies that she is now selling, her blog, and her twitter-- he even gave out her twitter handle, seriously.   \n\nHe then spend about 30 minutes doing essentially what was a \"live infomercial\" for his new ventriloquism starter kit witch includes a \"little Jeff dummy\" that is sold in the gift shop.  He even read from/performed the ventriloquism act from the book that's sold with the kit.  I don't want to learn ventriloquism, I wanted to see it performed by a professional.\n\nThe ventriloquism act itself was short, and, honestly was just okay.  Jeff spent about 5-10 minutes on each of the characters (Walter, Bubba J, Peanut + Jose, and Achmed).  I've seen him perform better in the past. The voices were not good as they used to be and a lot of the characters said the same lines--- \"funny as hell\", it seems he's just phoning it in and collecting the cash.   He's not the same eager performer as he was years ago and you can see this in his act.\n\nHe performed new material for our audience, but he really hadn't rehearsed it and was just reading from a note pad.

The service was fine: friendly, helpful, although a bit inconsistent in their attentiveness.  As for atmosphere, not much to say but no complaints either.  It's a deli/takeout place in addition to being a restaurant.  The TV and a lot of table conversation is in Spanish, which certainly adds to the authenticity of the place.\n\nService and atmosphere were fine; the food is why I didn't love the place.  I tried 2 appetizers, the spinach pie and the Argentine chorizo.  The spinach pie portion was huge!  It's spinach, eggs, and onions in a flaky pastry.  Good enough, and for just $4.95, almost a meal in itself.  The chorizo was fine, but nothing spectacular.  I tried the skirt steak, again a huge portion for $19.95.  Two people with reasonable appetites could share the spinach pie and skirt steak and be perfectly satisfied.  The quality of the beef was very good, but the steak tasted too much like the gas flame it was grilled over.  Obviously, no wood grill at Rincon.  Also, I ordered the steak medium-rare, but it came out closer to medium, a mistake a lot of steakhouses make.  The steak came with a choice of potato, soup, salad, or mixed vegetables.  The mixed vegetables looked like the once-frozen variety, but at least good quality frozen veggies.  I got the huge portion of veggies wrapped because I wanted to try a couple of their desserts.  The Argentine alfajor was two thin cookies with a caramel paste in the middle, then dipped in white chocolate, good enough but not great.  The mil hojas (the Argentine version of a mille feuille) was what I really wanted to try.  Instead of pastry cream, the Argentine version fills the pastry layers with a caramel paste.  Even though I have a wicked sweet tooth, this was way too sweet for me.\n\nDespite my tepid review of Rincon de Buenos Aires, I could see myself going back.  The prices and quality of their meats make for an excellent value.  And I loved the authenticity of the place.  Even if their execution isn't always top-notch, I had no doubt that this was true Argentine cuisine.  If I have a beef craving but don't want to spend big bucks at one of the Strip steakhouses, I'd much rather spend my $$ at Rincon than some place like Outback.

Sure, there are a few stores which seem like they are barely clinging to life, like Marshall's, and in fairness, there a few restaurants at street level which honestly seem to be doing well. However, go the basement level and you will see half-bored-out-their-mind store owners just standing there, probably thinking about how bad of an idea was to get a lease at the Aurora. \n\nYou feel kind of guilty since when you walk by and make eye contact, some owners will outright ignore you but some will spruce up, and give you a look that sort of says, \"Here! Come! PLEASE, enter my store! Check my wares.\" Then it will change to slight disillusion when you walk right past their store front.\n\nTheir underground food court is pretty much more of the same.

I have always thought of them as emergency food stations. Places you purchase food only when you are desperate, and are looking to to avoid hypoglycemia... if I was diabetic. \n\nAnyway, so I dropped by and tried a few of their curries and damn, they are delicious.

Just more subdued. A single cultural bracelet, a single long necklace with amulet, one ear with multiple piercings. This is when we realized why they were there too, with us, in that place that day.

I do wish they'd put chairs instead of benches.  Slightly awkward if you're alone or want to really relax.\n- Gorgeous grounds\n- delicious desert counter in the evenings in the lobby!\n\nHowever,\n- We booked online through the Starwood website.  None of our requests (only 2) were sent to the hotel.  We're talking simple things like non-alergenic pillows and high floor.  We got in late, so I addressed it the next morning and was told whoever booked it must not have transferred the codes.  I showed her the notes on my printed confirmation and told her I don't care what internal issues are involved.  Bottom line, I didn't get anything I requested.  \n- Room had an adjoining door.  Luckily the first night, nobody was next door.  The 2nd night, I got to listen to the couple next door talking, watching TV, and then having sex.  At the sex point I finally called the front desk (after 11pm) and told them I need another room to sleep in and that I'm leaving my stuff here.  I just want to sleep and come back in the morning.  The sent me to a room in the middle of a hallway completely surrounded by other rooms, more than my first room.  I refused - finally got a room at far end of hallway and slept soundly.  Next morning when trying to charge breakfast and other items, staff kept saying we checked out.  Had to explain over and over that we're not checked out.  Anyway, it wasn't the couple's fault next door - the walls are just paper thin.\n- Tried to book a cabana at adult pool in advance, but was told they only do full day cabana rentals.  Bummer.  Didn't reserve one since I knew I wouldn't be to pool until 2pm.  Got to pool and probably only 4 out of about 15 cabanas appeared to be booked.  Apparently, they'd rather leave money on the table instead of doing half day rentals of cabanas.  Oh well.  They could have made more that day.  Spoke to pool manager later (just by chance) and he said, oh, see me next time.  I can arrange it for you.  OK, well I called the number on the website for cabana rentals.  Apparently, that's not the route to take.  The spa doesn't have the authority to do 1/2 day.  DON'T make me jump through hoops to figure out who to talk to.  I'm just trying to spend money!!!  The cabanas are not worth it anyway.  They're just patio tables under the tent.  Not like other hotels that have TV's, ceiling fans, etc.  These cabanas are old and outdated.\n- Pool service ended at 6, at which time children are allowed at the adult pool when their's closes.  At 6pm there was probably still 25 adults at the pool.  Such a shame, more money left on the table.  These people would continue to order food and drinks if they could.  Oh well.\n- Pool menu is very limited for drinks.  If you want white zinfandel, you're set.  There's only 3 wines and they won't go to another bar to get more options (I kept forgetting I'm not at the Four Seasons).  What you see is what you get and we're not going to do anything else.\n- 1 server for entire adult pool area.  This is Scottsdale and it's high season.  Seriously - get some help out here.\n- Green your room - this is one of those hotels where you're assaulted with fliers about reusing your towels, get extra SPG points for not having maid service, save water, save our world, etc.  How about no maid service, & give me $50 off my bill.  Why tell me to conserve water when you have green grass surrounding your entire resort, including alongside the pool, driveway, walkways, etc.  How about instead of telling me to conserve water, you conserve water and rip out some of your unnecessary grass in the DESERT!  If I'm paying your rates, I want a fresh towel!  Do you really need grass lining the 1/4 mile long driveway and around the pool that needs watered year around?  \n- I'm not cheap, but the room service breakfast prices are seriously out of control.  I think the cheap breakfast was $24.00 + $3.00 delivery + 22% gratuity.  Really?  22% we're charging now???  When will it cap out?  And I don't understand the delivery fees hotels charge for room service.  Work it into the $24 eggs I'm ordering and $14 pot of coffee.  What's my alternative?  Will you let me go to the kitchen and bring it up myself?  I will.\n\nOK - I'm out of room to type according to Yelp.\n\nAfter talking to manager at check out about the noise issue and requests not honored at check in, no refund, no discount, just extra SPG points.

I like the space itself, indoors and out, and want to support local restaurants, farmers, artisans, etc. For the most part, I am docking this place down for terrible service and a terrible service model for food that isn't cheap.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that this place operates on a Pei-Wei type service model. Order at the front, tip (for service you don't receive) and your food is brought out to you and you are never talked to again. Fill your own water. Wait, you want another drink, well go get it yourself from the bar.\n\nHowever, what seems to be the service exception is the bar. Which is why I like to sit at the bar. You're supposed to have service because you are paying after you eat.\n\nBut - you see, I have been here probably 5 times in the past 4 weeks. Out of those times, I would say 4 of them I or my friends have had to flag down the bartender or the server (not sure if they are really supposed to be servers, because they don't ask how your food is, or provide much service other than delivering the food) in the restaurant for an item. And  I mean chase a bartender/server down to get a drink when there is no one at the bar. The seats at the bar weren't always filled, and bartenders aren't stressed with orders, just dawdling and not paying attention to customers at all. Cleaning the espresso machine, making lemon twists, making orange juice, not paying any attention to what is going on with their customers. Each time I have been seated at a bar, the bartender has never proactively ever asked me what I would like to drink, nor have they asked if I would like a refill. \n\nSame goes for the restaurant - seated at a table - our food took 25-30 mins to come out, (fries 5 mins after the burger) and after it came out, the server was nowhere to be found. (But again, are they really servers? Are they supposed to provide service?) All we needed was some extra silverware and some extra ketchup. (Fries only come with one little cup of ketchup) Once we saw her, I ordered a new drink - and that took another 15-20 minutes to come out, at which time, I was close to finished with my food.\n\nOverall, when the food comes out, it is good. However, the burger is $10 and doesn't include fries ($3 and ask for them extra crispy)... and remember... no service. So I am conflicted - if I want a good burger and no service, I might as well go to Five Guys (cheaper and better) or it's this place's sister restaurant St. Francis, where I can pay about the same price for burger and fries and have a server.\n\nFinally, the local wares. Yes! I want to support local - I'm not sure who is doing the pricing on these items. A cotton grocery bag with a screen print of the logo - $14? That is nuts! I can get one at Fresh and Easy for $.99. Again, I get the local thing. But appropriate pricing is also relevant. A 2.2 lb bag of flour for $9? I would pay around $5 - because it's local, but $9? When the pricing is so drastically different than what you can get at the grocery store ($2.49 for 5 lbs of flour) it does a disservice to local producers as the price is so disproportionate its somewhat unaffordable to buy local. (And 2.2 lbs of flour isn't going to last long.) \n\nI would definitely encourage you to try this out (and the market next door). It's definitely worth a look.

There were 10 of us and we ordered ceviche (fish and shrimp mixed), veggie quesadilla, carne asada burrito with enchilada sauce, carne asada fries, shrimp tacos, and fish tacos. Everything was delicious. My favorite was the ceviche and the fish tacos. The owner and his daughters were very attentive and nice. I will definitely eat here again.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "I don't know what it is about Popeyes, but their fried chicken is so good! I once got KFC because I was like, \"oh they're both fried chicken so it's probably going to be about the same.\" No way! I don't really know what happened to KFC but it's not as good as it used to be.\n\nPopeyes is really good at making every location taste consistent. It always tastes fresh and crispy. The spicy option is also great. The mashed potatoes and fries are yummy but all the other sides are okay. \n\nService was good here. Definitely recommend this squeaky new location.", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "Basic sushi place. Not great. Not bad. It took more than 20 mins to get our check after asking 2 times. It was lunch time on a weekday and maybe 2 other groups. We sat at the sushi bar and one of the chefs was nice enough. Nothing to write home about.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "Hotbox Salon has become my go-to for my hair. I bounced around a lot from salon to salon, until now! I originally came here because I got a Groupon for a special cut and deep-conditioning. I had my appointment with Toni and she is amazing. She knows hair very well, especially my wavy/curly locks that tend to distress other hairdressers. But she was not phased.\n\nRecently I went back for a simple color, nothing crazy, just sticking to my natural brown, just a bit darker, but mostly to cover my greys. Toni was very accomodating and came in early on a Friday morning to make sure I could get my hair done with plenty of time before I had to be at work at 11:30 AM.\n\nThe salon serves up water AND coffee in the mornings. I was treated to a nice cup of joe while getting my hair done.\n\nAlso of note, the salon is very clean and I love the ambiance - the Craftsman toolboxes where the hair dressers keep their stuff is awesome. I've also always had a good repertoire with the receptionist here as well. \n\nI will be returning here, of course, for everything that has to do with my hair.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "So thankful for the guys at this shop. They patched my tire FOR FREE and had me on my way in 15 minutes. The place was clean and I was greeted right away. Most definitely will be back when I need tires!", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "We had excellent service and the food was really great!  The bread was awesome.  Who doesn't love complimentary bread?  It's made in shop and you can order some for take home as well.  Ordered the veggie lasagna and the salmon.  Both excellent.  The tiramisu is literally best I've ever eaten.  Apple tart was the only thing that was blah.  Otherwise we will be back.", "stars": 4.0}]
