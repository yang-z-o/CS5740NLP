[{"text": "I USED to brag about Urban Beans to everyone I know. I used to hang out there at least 3 times a week. THEN something horrifying happened, my once favorite coffee place changed! & it morphed into something no longer identifiable. I took my mother to Urban Beans, upon walking in the door the entire restaurant was permeated by extreme body odor. Not only was the smell gagging, but all but 1 of the tables was dirty. The only 1 without dirty dishes was sticky. Still, we attempted to order coffee however, a large mocha & a small black coffee was apparently a brain teaser for the barista. Our simple order was messed up twice. We tried again, by ordering bread pudding French toast. Alas, this was again a big mistake. Not only was our food served cold, it came with no utensils. I was so embarrassed I spent the entire afternoon apologizing to my mom. I have never been back nor will I ever go back. PSA-There is a Tip Jar located at the register but beware, our very astute & creative barista automatically added a 15% gratuity to our bill. AND never request a glass of water or you will be pointed to an empty pitcher without a glass to be found within the vicinity of this zip code. Frightful indeed.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "I really liked my first experience here. Unfortunately that was destroyed today when I came back in for a follow up exam and fecal sample.  $70 for a one-minute check up to ensure that the treatment prescribed by them one month ago was effective.  When I questioned he cost the young lady was very nice but simply apologized and simply said \"sorry they should've told you that it would be another full exam fee.\"  \n\nNever again. What a shame. I have no problem paying for service when I receive value for it but when it is just gouging that's not worth it.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "Literally shit. Do yourself a favor and go to the food court in Palms, because the Chinese food here is horrible. \n\nFirst, we ordered the pho, expecting some sort of resemblance to the savory Vietnamese noodle dish familiar to our (admittedly) spoiled taste buds. Unfortunately, the noodles were too thick, the broth had no flavor, and the temperature was lukewarm. \n\nNext, we got the orange chicken, which was worse than Panda Express's. Once again, it was cooked to a lukewarm temperature, but the texture of the chicken made it apparent that it was bought from Costco or something. \n\nFinally, to everyone familiar with Chinese/Taiwanese hotpot: it's not hotpot. A more appropriate title would have been \"beef stew.\"\n\nBtw it's really expensive without Palms club membership.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "This place was terrible. Healthy is great, but no seasoning for veggies?  When I asked how the veggies are seasoned, the girl looked at me like I had 5 heads. There are seasonings that can be added such as i.e. garlic, ginger, etc. that add flavor and are healthy. The sauces are disgusting. Sickos.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "Came a Saturday morning, wasn't busy.  Tables were clearing out and we were yet to get our order of the classic breakfast and avocado toast.    Seemed chaotic and it was absolutely terrible.", "stars": 1.0}]
